    %h2.blue How to Get Here
    .purple
      %h3 Public Transportation
      %p Metro buses 9, 10, 11, 43, 49, 60, and 84 all have stops within a block of the venue. The venue is also a 20 minute, up hill walk from Westlake, the LightRail's last stop.
      %p
        The
        %a{ href: "http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } King County Trip Planner
        and
        %a{ href: "http://pugetsound.onebusaway.org/", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } OneBusAway
        are helpful public transit resources.

      %h3 Parking
      %p
        %strong Friday:
        Most nearby street parking has a two hour maximum, so your best bet is to use one of the many nearby parking lots and
        garages. The most convenient garage to use is about a block east of the BPH, and it has a $10 early bird rate.
        The internet is holding the address of this garage secret, so we'll just give you
        %a{ href: "https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rock+Box", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } this map,
        which points to a particular karaoke establishment of which we are quite fond. The garage is one door to the North of that.
      %p
        %strong Saturday:
        You will find no better deal or convenience than the
        %a{ href: "https://www.google.com/maps/place/1609+Harvard+Ave,+Seattle,+WA+98122/", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } Harvard Garage
        across the street directly behind the BPH. There’s plenty of space, and it costs $5 for all day/night.

      %h3 Biking
      %p
        There are a number of public bike racks located nearby, including along Broadway in front of the venue and on the 3rd level of the
        %a{ href: "http://www.seattlecentral.edu/transportation/", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } college's parking garage located at Harvard and Pine.

        You may heard that we have a wee smidge of coffee here in Seattle, and this is true (except, by "wee smidge", we mean "vast oceans"). Here are some of the quaint and delicious options in the area:

    .purple
      %p The blocks around the BPH are chock-a-block with great restaurants! Here are some favorites, but the list is by no means exhaustive. Feel free to explore the neighborhood - you will likely find something fantastic that we haven’t included.
      %p We've made a note of the places that have the widest range of vegan and/or gluten free options, but most other restaurants on this do have some options as well.
      %ul
        %li
          %a{ href:"http://www.thestranger.com/locations/1202302/rancho-bravo-tacos", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } Rancho Bravo
          &ndash; taco truck turned brick-and-mortar, in an old KFC, no less. Hands down, best cheap burrito on Capitol Hill. A lot of vegan and GF options.
        %li
          %a{ href:"http://www.oddfellowscafe.com/", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } Oddfellows Cafe
          &ndash; mostly organic and local rustic American fare.
        %li
          %a{ href:"http://lostlakecafe.com/location/", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } Lost Lake Cafe
          &ndash; this diner feels like a 60s hunting lodge had babies with a hipster. Big menu.
        %li
          %a{ href:"http://www.capitolcider.com/", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } Capitol Cider
          has pretty much all the alcoholic cider in the world. And you might not notice at first glance, but the food menu is 100% gluten free. Not even joking.
        %li
          On top of the QFC on Broadway and Pike. No, we're serious. Take the escalator up and you'll find

    %h2.blue Nightlife
    .purple
      %p Seattle's a fun town, and there are a lot of different kinds of awesome things you can do at the end of the day. Here is a list of some things to do right nearby that would be good places to go with, say, a group of folks you just met at a super fun conference:
      %ul
        %li
          %a{ href:"http://www.gammaraygamestore.com/", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } RayGun Lounge
          &ndash; game store with a big hangout area with lots of tables. There are a number of restaurants right close if you want to grab dinner, then go get your board game on.
        %li
          %a{ href:"http://garagebilliards.com/mambo/", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } Garage
          is a pool hall (not, in fact, a garage) that <i>also</i> has bowling and a dinner menu with some gluten-free and vegan options.
        %li
          %a{ href:"http://www.centuryballroom.com/home/calendar/2015-10", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } Century Ballroom
          &ndash; if partner dancing is your jam, you're in luck. Century Ballroom is a gorgeous and lively lesbian-owned ballroom with a friendly, fun vibe. They're having a salsa dance Friday night, and both salsa and swing dances Saturday night - all of which start with an intro lesson.
        %li
          %a{ href:"http://johnjohnsgameroom.com/find-us/", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } John John's Game Room
          is a game room (as its name implies) with 80s arcade games and pinball.
        %li
          %a{ href:"http://www.dilettante.com/Mocha-Cafe/Broadway", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } Dilletante Chocolates
          has pretty much all the chocolate things that ever were chocolate. We're talking hot cocoa, chocolate martinis, cake, mousse, sundaes - and a bajillion kinds of each.
        %li
          %a{ href:"http://www.baitshopseattle.com/", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } Bait Shop
          &ndash; you won't find it hard to find a bar, if that's what you're looking for. But if you want one with some space and not quite as jam packed, try Bait Shop. It's a charming dive(ish) bar with great food - it's about 3/4 mile from the BPH, which puts it in a slightly less trafficked part of Capitol Hill, and thus can be mellower than some of the bars right nearby.
        %li
          %a{ href:"Roy Street Coffee and Tea", target: "_blank", class: "pink" } Roy Street Coffee and Tea
          is a big, cozy coffee shop right near Bait Shop, and it's open til 11pm Friday and Saturday nights. (Bauhaus is also open quite late on weekend nights.)
    %p
      %strong NOTE:
      The area between Broadway and 12th on Pike and Pine can be a little rowdy after the night gets going. Consider travelling in groups or heading a different direction if that's not a safe or enjoyable vibe for you. (The above options are largely outside of that area, but we thought we'd give you a heads up.)
