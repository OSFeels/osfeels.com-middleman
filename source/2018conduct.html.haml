    %h3#purpose Purpose
    %p
      A primary goal of Open Source & Feelings is to be safe, inclusive, and
      welcoming to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and
      diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a
      friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender,
      gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical
      appearance, body size, socioeconomic status, race, age, or religion (or lack thereof).
    %p

      in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

    %h3#open-citizenship Open Citizenship
    %p
      A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open citizenship
      by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships
      between our actions and their effects on our community.

      Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action
      is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power
      that exist in society.

        If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our
        community is safe, welcoming, inclusive friendly, and encourages all
        participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.
