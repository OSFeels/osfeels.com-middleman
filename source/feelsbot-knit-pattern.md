# Feelsbot Felted Plushy Pattern
## by Brenna Flood (@brennx0r)
-------------------------------

## Materials Needed
One hank each of the following Cascade 220 colors:

* DRK: dark heathered green
* T:   heathered teal
* Y:   yellow
* Pur:   purple

1 set straight or circular knitting needles, US8

1 set dpn needles, US8

tapestry needle for ends weaving

## Head - Front

The front of the head is knitted flat using 3 different colors.

I have used both Fair Isle and Intarsia techniques for this, and
both have their pros/cons. 

If you've never done multi-colored knitting before, these videos
are great references:

Intarsia:  http://www.knittinghelp.com/video/play/intarsia-color-knitting

Pick the method that works the best for you. <3
