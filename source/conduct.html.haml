      ### <a class="confetti confetti--heart" name="purpose">Purpose</a>

      A primary goal of Open Source and Feelings is to be safe, inclusive, and welcoming to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, socioeconomic status, race, age, or religion (or lack thereof).

      This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

      We invite all those who participate in Open Source and Feelings to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

      ### <a class="confetti confetti--heart" name="open-citizenship">Open Citizenship</a>

      A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

      Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

      **If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is safe, welcoming, inclusive friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.** Tell an organizer or email them at [conduct@osfeels.com](mailto:conduct@osfeels.com).

      ### <a class="confetti confetti--heart" name="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>

      All attendees, organizers, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at Open Source & Feelings are required to abide by the code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.

      Open Source & Feelings is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, socioeconomic status, race, age, or religion (or lack thereof).

      #### <a class="blue" name="reporting-guidelines">Reporting Guidelines</a>

      If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible at [conduct@osfeels.com](mailto:conduct@osfeels.com).
