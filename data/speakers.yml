  title: "Now We're Cooking With STEAM: Humanities in Computer Science Education"
  abstract:
    "There's been a recent push for incorporating computer science into high school classrooms, while some schools struggle to find funding for their art and music programs. This talk asks \"Why not both?\" and explores the ways that incorporating art can benefit a computer science curriculum, using Bubblesort Zines as a case study."

  title: "Burnout and the Cult of Busy"
  abstract:
    "Our culture glorifies busyness, and perhaps the worst of it can be found in the tech industry. Workers at startups brag about how much they work, and how little they sleep. Engineers forgo lunch for more hours at their desk, social media is riddled with #hustlin and #riseandgrind, and everyone is available at all times. This kind of stress is bad for employees, and bad for business. This talk will cover the importance of self-care, avoiding burnout, and ways to set boundaries to protect your health."

  title: "Venn and the Art of Identity"
  abstract:
    "We look at ourselves in context of others. We have a primal nature to classify, categorize, and organize things into groups that support us and help us grow, and those that harm us and make us wither. We do this with nature, food, religion, people, and anything else you can imagine. It is the root cause of strife in the world, but it also is the bedrock on which our misaligned society is built on.
    </p><p>
    Having grown up a square peg, I often attempted to fit into the round holes. And while sometimes I could slip through the opening and mingle with all the cylinders, I never truly fit in. As much camouflage as I wore, I never had anything that ever felt like my identity, and never thought I would.
    </p><p>
    Eventually, I settled into a societally approved role in my twenties, only to have it shatter a few years later. I tried again in my thirties with the same results. Now, after an long and arduous journey, I am less sure of who I am, yet more confident that I am true to myself. I know that it is okay to have an identity that doesn't fit a happy little picture of what society says is allowed. I know how society views me, even if it is wrong. I'm ready to be myself, and I'll flip society on it's head to be recognized as square peg in a world of round holes.
    </p><p>
    Using my journey as an example, we'll walk through finding your personal venn diagram of identity and finding the empathy for others even when we have nothing in common."

  title: "How To Contribute to a Project without Coding"
  abstract:
    "Getting aligned and connected to each other as well as the objective and ultimate goal of a project before the first line of code is written is critical for long-term success. Building a solid foundation based on the relationships between both the team members as well as the intended audience of the project allows much more than the code itself to manifest. The energy we put into our code is the energy our audience feels as they use it. Bringing this awareness and intention to any project is a common step missed. I will talk about ways to bring and maintain this step, this perspective, as a team member."

  title: "Inclusion, Diversity's Less-Understood Sibling"
  abstract:
    "In the necessary rush to examine the diversity data in our field, we've dropped an important facet of this work: Inclusion. As we increase our diversity across a myriad axes, what do we *do* with it? How do we support our communities to grow, thrive, and ensure that the benefits of diversity are actually realized? The talk will cover the *what* and *how* of building inclusive culture online and off."

  title: "Open Ambiguity: Love, Labor, Exhaustion and Resistance in an Openwashed World"
  abstract:
    "\"Owning pipelines, people, products or even intellectual property is no longer the key to success. Openness is,\" proclaims Internet pundit Jeff Jarvis. Opensource has gone mainstream, and everyone wants to be down with open. But what does \"open\" mean these days? And how does the ambiguity of openness, which allows for the extraction of free labor from individuals eager to contribute to open source projects (because love) by institutions eager to #openwash all of the things (because capitalism) impact us beyond the technologies they produce?
    </p><p>
    Under this apolitical free-for-all: How do the social and ethical values associated with our technologies get defined and expressed? When do the practical benefits of an efficient development model start to give way to shared exhaustion? Finally, how do we collaborate without giving away our power?"

  title: "Why I'm Bringing Robots to Prison"
  abstract:
    "As Star Wars recently reminded us, robots are very popular. What Star Wars didn't explain, along with why Death Stars are so easy to blow up, is how robots can reduce recidivism.
    </p><p>
    This talk explores the landscape and demographics of our prison system, the role that tech  plays today, and how the tech community, a group that prides itself on solutions-oriented innovation, can turn our strengths toward solving problems here in our community."
