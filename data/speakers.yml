  title: "Now We're Cooking With STEAM: Humanities in Computer Science Education"
  abstract:
    "There's been a recent push for incorporating computer science into high school classrooms, while some schools struggle to find funding for their art and music programs. This talk asks \"Why not both?\" and explores the ways that incorporating art can benefit a computer science curriculum, using Bubblesort Zines as a case study."

  title: "Burnout and the Cult of Busy"
  abstract:
    "Our culture glorifies busyness, and perhaps the worst of it can be found in the tech industry. Workers at startups brag about how much they work, and how little they sleep. Engineers forgo lunch for more hours at their desk, social media is riddled with #hustlin and #riseandgrind, and everyone is available at all times. This kind of stress is bad for employees, and bad for business. This talk will cover the importance of self-care, avoiding burnout, and ways to set boundaries to protect your health."

  title: "Venn and the Art of Identity"
  abstract:
    "We look at ourselves in context of others. We have a primal nature to classify, categorize, and organize things into groups that support us and help us grow, and those that harm us and make us wither. We do this with nature, food, religion, people, and anything else you can imagine. It is the root cause of strife in the world, but it also is the bedrock on which our misaligned society is built on.
    </p><p>
    Having grown up a square peg, I often attempted to fit into the round holes. And while sometimes I could slip through the opening and mingle with all the cylinders, I never truly fit in. As much camouflage as I wore, I never had anything that ever felt like my identity, and never thought I would.
    </p><p>
    Eventually, I settled into a societally approved role in my twenties, only to have it shatter a few years later. I tried again in my thirties with the same results. Now, after an long and arduous journey, I am less sure of who I am, yet more confident that I am true to myself. I know that it is okay to have an identity that doesn't fit a happy little picture of what society says is allowed. I know how society views me, even if it is wrong. I'm ready to be myself, and I'll flip society on it's head to be recognized as square peg in a world of round holes.
    </p><p>
    Using my journey as an example, we'll walk through finding your personal venn diagram of identity and finding the empathy for others even when we have nothing in common."

  title: "How To Contribute to a Project without Coding"
  abstract:
    "Getting aligned and connected to each other as well as the objective and ultimate goal of a project before the first line of code is written is critical for long-term success. Building a solid foundation based on the relationships between both the team members as well as the intended audience of the project allows much more than the code itself to manifest. The energy we put into our code is the energy our audience feels as they use it. Bringing this awareness and intention to any project is a common step missed. I will talk about ways to bring and maintain this step, this perspective, as a team member."

  title: "Inclusion, Diversity's Less-Understood Sibling"
  abstract:
    "In the necessary rush to examine the diversity data in our field, we've dropped an important facet of this work: Inclusion. As we increase our diversity across a myriad axes, what do we *do* with it? How do we support our communities to grow, thrive, and ensure that the benefits of diversity are actually realized? The talk will cover the *what* and *how* of building inclusive culture online and off."

  title: "Open Ambiguity: Love, Labor, Exhaustion and Resistance in an Openwashed World"
  abstract:
    "\"Owning pipelines, people, products or even intellectual property is no longer the key to success. Openness is,\" proclaims Internet pundit Jeff Jarvis. Opensource has gone mainstream, and everyone wants to be down with open. But what does \"open\" mean these days? And how does the ambiguity of openness, which allows for the extraction of free labor from individuals eager to contribute to open source projects (because love) by institutions eager to #openwash all of the things (because capitalism) impact us beyond the technologies they produce?
    </p><p>
    Under this apolitical free-for-all: How do the social and ethical values associated with our technologies get defined and expressed? When do the practical benefits of an efficient development model start to give way to shared exhaustion? Finally, how do we collaborate without giving away our power?"

  title: "Why I'm Bringing Robots to Prison"
  abstract:
    "As Star Wars recently reminded us, robots are very popular. What Star Wars didn't explain, along with why Death Stars are so easy to blow up, is how robots can reduce recidivism.
    </p><p>
    This talk explores the landscape and demographics of our prison system, the role that tech  plays today, and how the tech community, a group that prides itself on solutions-oriented innovation, can turn our strengths toward solving problems here in our community."

  title: "Digital Engagement, Community, & Imagination"
  abstract:
    "We use platforms like Facebook to find, connect, and build alliances with the people who can work together to co-create self-sustaining systems that promote our individual agendas. This talk will explore spaces that eclipse both the real and digital worlds. Marin will outline how she has used performance, poetry, and visual art as strategic communication tools to establish spaces for deeper engagement on topics from birth control and gender identity, to white privilege and racism. Her work with projects like Red Lineage, Miko Kuro's Midnight Tea, SPoCS (Seattle People of Color Salon) and #WhiteOrWrong allow the idea of community and imagination to grow and thrive through different levels of engagement, modes of connection, and methods of encounter."

  title: "The Ethics and Responsibilities of Open Source in the IoT"
  abstract:
    "The Internet of Things is upon us, whether we like it or not. From doorknobs to refrigerators to automobiles to medical devices, internet connectivity is becoming integrated not just into our consumer technology, but also our culture and everyday lives. Open source software (and hardware!) is already a part of IoT development, but to what extent do open source developers have a responsibility to the products and end users they affect? The extent of IoT adoption has the power to both empower and harm people in ways never before possible. 
    </p><p>
    In this talk, we will explore the ethical landscape of IoT development. We'll talk about IoT security and robustness. We'll discuss the leftpad incident and what impact that may have on an IoT future. We'll also explore how certain industries (e.g. the medical device industry) are regulated with respect to open source and software development in general, and ultimately what responsibilities and powers developers have to forge the IoT into a force of good."

  title: "Standing Desks and Free Pizza: Body Image Negotiations in Tech Spaces"
  abstract:
    "\"Watching my carbs.\" \"Where'd you get the exercise ball chair?\" \"Getting a salad today.\" \"I don't know why they keep putting all these heavy beers on tap.\" \"You try that new lunch place?\" \"I don't know, still recovering from leg day.\"
    </p><p>
    Tech is notoriously bad at talking about the intersections of class, disability, race, gender - health, weight, and embodiment are equally nuanced subjects all on their own. What happens when a self-consciously desk-oriented culture tries to over-correct? What happens when people tire of beer and pizza that no longer feels optional, and \"health\" is the cleanest way out? What happens when your coworkers and your mobile phone both follow your gym progress? What happens to those who are already hyper-aware that their bodies are battlegrounds? How do we find some socially-acceptable balance in these interwoven networks of expectation and self-care?
    </p><p>
    This talk will explore the complex landscape of body image negotiation in tech-specific cultural spaces, and hopefully offer a couple of tools to enable a baseline level of body-positive communication with tech coworkers."

  title: "Community is a verb"
  abstract: 
    "Shit blew up again. The maintainers of this repo were clueless & unhelpful. That conference refuses to use a code of conduct. The other conference has one but it's not enough. Twitter erupts, folks are angry and hurt, and people you thought were friends turn out to apparently be idiots!
    </p><p>
    One way to get through it would be to just get rid of all the idiots. But that's really hard, and besides, they might be trying to get rid of you.
    </p><p>
    How do you stay compassionate and get past the divide? How do you do that and stay true to your values? Is dialogue possible?
    </p><p>
    Empathy doesn't have to cost you your soul. Wielded with skill, it can make stuff hurt a lot less, leaving you energy for changing the world!"

  title: "Unpopular Tech and Why It Was AMAZING"
  abstract:
    "Turn the narrative about \"crufty old legacy technology\" on its head! From CGI scripts, to PHP, from TCL to MySQL, explore why these technologies were exciting and what led to their success. Programming as a profession is forward looking and this sometimes leads us to forget how much influence they've had on what we do today. 
    </p><p>
    This talk will be half history lesson, half cheer leading now unpopular technologies."
