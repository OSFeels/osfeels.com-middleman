    "In games, a valuable team is made up of characters with varied talents and skills. They need to be adaptable, to communicate, and most of all, to work together. As a team, they can accomplish even the most intimidating quests. It's time we took this mentality to the open source community.
    </p><p>
    Roleplaying games can teach us a lot about diversity and working as a team if we dig a little deeper. In such games, players take on the role of a fantasy character and participate in quests and adventures with a group of other players. During this talk, I will take popular fantasy classes and relate them to the variety of people who contribute to open source communities every day.
    </p><p>
    Just like a roleplaying party would fail with only type of character, open source needs the unsung heroes: the technical writers, the artists, the testers—to make the project a reality. By building our 'party' around diverse interests and welcoming newcomers with open arms, open source communities can prosper."

    </p><p>
    We'll talk about reporting processes, documentation, creating a team or committee to handle reports, what responses are or aren't effective, and dealing with problems in the heat of the moment."

    This talk explores patterns in company-sponsored open source projects, actions which influence the acceptability of those projects by the open source community, and opportunities for companies to participate wholeheartedly in the open source community.

    "This talk will cover my view of documentation within programming culture as it has grown over the years. As a primary person involved with Read the Docs (the largest open source doc hosting website) and Write the Docs (the largest OSS doc conference), I have seen a lot of angles, and appreciate documentation more every year.
    </p><p>
    I believe better documentation is a fundamental aspect of how we can improve programming culture, and an often misunderstood part of outreach and education. Projects with good documentation are able to get contributors in a much more reliable fashion, and, more importantly, projects without documentation only attract users who have time to waste.
    </p><p>
    This talk will make you think more deeply about the social impact of documentation, and hopefully make you question if it should be a higher priority in your development. You should understand the role of documentation in both technical as well as social realms."

    "In the tech industry, and especially in the open source community, there are many frustrations and problems that everyone experiences. It is no secret, however, that these problems are not evenly distributed. Those who tend to be underrepresented in the industry find their feelings of marginalization compounded by behavior that has come to be viewed as the norm.
    </p><p>
    And while it is also no secret that speaking out about these issues can in itself be a problem, it is not as simple as it seems. Will standing up to injustice harm your career? Are harassment and *-ism just something you should expect? Is there a certain initiation/hazing period that you have to simply suffer through before you can be taken seriously? Do certain marginalized subgroups have it worse than others, and what does that mean for those who don't have it the worst? In this talk, we'll take a deep dive into the many not-often-discussed nuances of a widely known problem."

    "Managing open source projects exposes a maintainer to the vagaries of the internet. For all the joy and convenience that a bit of technology may bring to its users, users typically show up when they are in an unhappy place, and the job of the maintainer can quickly become an overwhelming source of stress and burnout.
    </p><p>
    This talk will introduce Non-Violent Communication as a toolkit for helping users at their worst, and also prevent the flood of bad vibes from becoming a source of toxicity. By exposing our vulnerability in a direct and honest way, we can turn conversations away from blame and antagonism, towards meaningful connection and opportunities for growth and collaboration. Open source is a social machine, and compassion helps keep the gears from grinding to a halt."

    Negative self-talk is a pervasive, invasive, and unproductive way of thinking. It can trigger a cascade of things, from abandoned patches (“I am not smart/talented/good enough to figure this out”), to withdrawl from the community (“I screwed this up and everyone knows and hates me”), to general discouragement (“I suck, and have nothing valuable to contribute here”).

    In this talk, I’ll discuss the various methods Dreamwidth and other organizations use to handle negative self-talk, and the best way to deploy those techniques.

    "I've heard it before from people in positions of privilege - \"If you don't feel represented, then why don't you create something of your own?\" After more than two-and-a-half years working in the tech industry, I always felt that living on the intersection of race and gender were seldom addressed in tech initiatives, and in work spaces I seldom encountered other professional women of color outside of the service staff.
    </p><p>
    In an effort to get over the feelings of isolation, a friend and I created a Twitter chat using the then-underused #WOCinTech hashtag in an effort to bridge the geographic and workplace barriers and connect with women of color already in the tech industry and connect with each other.
    </p><p>
    The chat has since grown to become a full-fledged community made up of women of color and nonbinary POC technologists, and our two-person team has responded to the needs of this community by creating initiatives that target these groups specifically.
    </p><p>
    In my talk, I'll discuss my experiences living at the intersection of race and gender, the #WOCinTech chat origin story, how connecting with women of color has empowered me professionally, and how the community wants to help others on their path to a career in tech."
